\begin{abstract} 

Over the years, we have witnessed various password-hash database breaches that 
have affected small and large companies, with a diversity of users and budgets.
The industry standard, salted hashing (and even key stretching), has proven
to be insufficient protection against attackers who now have access to clusters of
GPU-powered password crackers.  Although there are various proposals for better securing
password storage, most do not offer the same adoption model 
(software-only, server-side) as salted hashing, which may impede adoption.

In this paper, we present \PPH, a software-only, server-side password storage
mechanism that requires minimal additional work for the server, but 
exponentially increases the attacker's effort.  \PPH uses a threshold 
cryptosystem to interrelate stored password data so that passwords cannot be 
individually cracked.  Our analysis shows that \PPH is memory and storage
efficient, hard to crack, and easy to implement.  In many realistic scenarios, 
cracking a \PPH-enabled database would be infeasible even for an adversary
with millions of computers.
