        <p>Password database disclousures have caused companies billions of dollars in damages. Typically a password server securely obtains a password from the user, performs a salted hash on the password, and then checks if that entry matches what is in the password database under that user name.   Hackers have proven adept at stealing password databases from <a href="https://isis.poly.edu/%7Ejcappos/papers/tr-cse-2013-02.pdf">dozens</a> <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/pwnedlist-alerts-you-when-youve-been-hacked-for-a-price/10943">of</a> <a href="http://blog.passwordresearch.com/2013/02/passwords-found-in-wild-for-january-2013.html">companies</a>.  An attacker with the password database can try different passwords for a user and check if there is a match.</p>

<p>PolyPassHash stores password data in a different way (<a href="https://github.com/JustinCappos/PolyPassHash/blob/master/academic-writeup/paper.pdf">technical details</a>).   To understand the concept, imagine a flat piece of paper.   Instead of storing the salted password hash, PolyPassHash combines this value with a point on the piece of paper.   All of the correct passwords when salted will produce points that lie on the same line.   (For the cryptographically knowledgeable reader, the actual construct used is a Shamir Secret Share instead of points in a multi-dimensional space.)   The information about this line is a secret that is not stored on disk.   When an attacker tries to crack passwords, they will simultaneously guess multiple passwords (the line), which makes it <a href="#hardtocompute">amazingly hard to crack passwords</a>.   </p>

<p>When the server restarts, it also needs to recompute the line.   However, through the normal login process, users provide many correct passwords and so the server finds the line without problems.   This technique is very efficient for the server to compute and requires very little additional storage or memory.   Better yet, client computers do not need to be changed in any way to use this.   There are free, open source <a href="#implementation">implementations available</a> for PolyPassHash. So hopefully this technique will be coming to your favorite service to protect your password!</p>

<p>Suppose that three people have passwords that are each randomly chosen and 6 characters long.   A typical laptop can crack those passwords in about 1 hour.   </p>

<p>If you take the same passwords and protect them with PolyPassHash, every computer on the planet working together cannot crack the password in 1 hour.   In fact, to search the key space, it would take every computer on the planet <a href="https://github.com/JustinCappos/PolyPassHash/blob/master/academic-writeup/paper.pdf">longer than the universe is estimated to have existed</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible to use accounts that contribute to the line (threshold accounts) as a key to encrypt other account credentials (thresholdless account).   So an attacker can know any number of those thresholdless accounts and cannot crack other thresholdless account or the threshold accounts.   </p>

<p>This would require an attacker to be able to read memory from a running server.   Typically the server obtains the client's password in plain-text and then performs the salted hash.   So if an attacker can read memory on a running server, they can steal passwords unencrypted regardless of the technique that is used.</p>

<p>However, even if an attacker can recover the line / Shamir Secret Share, the account passwords are still salted and hashed.   So accounts are still protected using the standard salted and hashed techniques that people leverage today.   So in the worst case, PolyPassHash provides the same protection as what people are using today.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it turns out that the <a href="https://isis.poly.edu/%7Ejcappos/papers/tr-cse-2013-02.pdf">most commonly disclosed cause of password database compromise is SQL injection</a>, which does not imply the attacker can read arbitrary memory.   So in many cases, an attacker that can steal the database does not have this access.</p>

<p>The basic technique described here would require some number of users to provide correct login information before authorizing any of them.   However, <a href="https://github.com/JustinCappos/PolyPassHash/blob/master/academic-writeup/paper.pdf">our paper</a> discusses an extension that gets around this issue.   You can leak a small amount of information about the password hashes to allow checking.   Using the example above, this is similar to leaking the last few digits of the points.   An attacker still has a huge number of things to guess, but the server can check and eliminate most wrong passwords right after reboot.</p>

<p>Extremely weak passwords are a bad idea.   An attacker can guess things like password, etc. and just try them even if they do not have the database.   So do not use them regardless of the storage technology.</p>

<p>Another thing PolyPassHash does not protect against is password reuse.   Do not use the same password on multiple sites no matter how strong it is!   We recommend using a <a href="https://lastpass.com">password</a> <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">manager</a> that generates a separate, strong password per site.</p>

<p>This repository, contains the <a href="python-reference-implementation">PolyPassHash Python reference implementation</a>.   This is written for readability and not performance or practical use.   There is also a <a href="https://github.com/SantiagoTorres/PolyPassHash-C">C implementation</a> available.</p>

<p>We would love to see a PHP implementation for common frameworks because many password hash breaches <a href="http://blog.passwordresearch.com/2013/02/passwords-found-in-wild-for-january-2013.html">occur on these systems</a>.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you have an implementation of PolyPassHash that you would like us to list.</p>
